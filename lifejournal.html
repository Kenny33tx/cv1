<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p> It wasn't until about age 23 that I really started pondering life and
  actually sitting down to reflect on where I'd been in life and what I
  invisioned it to look like in the future. You see, the very first moment that
dropped this life realization on me was the birth of my daughter. Before her,
I'd been out late, partying, club promoting, not living at home, and just all
around wasting time. I had a little drive though, because I entered the United
States Air National Guard within that same year. The decision was the result of
the conception of my child. If it wasn't for her, I'd still probably be living
a less meaningul lifestyle. Fast forward to today, and I'll say, life has
thrown many a curve ball at me, but it has also provided a great deal of
insight and a hunger for a life unimaginable. But I can see it as if it were
standing right in front of me. A lot of people have a vision though, yet, a lot
are stuck on the where and how. One must understand, the search just doesn't
cease when you get it. its an insatiable hunger that cannot be turned off so
easily. Many get frustrated with the search and they just give up.
The hunt for answers to your vision is what makes it worth while. If it were
easily obtainable, would you feel accomplished? now, the biggest missing piece
to the how, or finally knowing what it takes to achieve your vision is the
execution. This here is where many find themselves in dispair. "Its too hard."
Let me hopefully be able to give the on switch to your desires. Ask yourself,
is it harder to let a life fulfilled just get away and live in a state of
what could have been, or is living out your purpose and enjoying that
invigorating sense of fulfillment "too hard"? </p>
